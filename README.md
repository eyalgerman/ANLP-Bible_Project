Final Project in Course: Advanced Topics in Natural Language Processing

**by:**
* Eyal German
* Yonatan Shnitz
* Eli Ben Shimol

## Approach
* In this project, we aim to investigate how well LLMs can answer different types of questions.
* To answer the given questions, the model will use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on the Bible.
* We want to evaluate the results on different models and various types of questions.

## Repository Structure

### Code
* **ANLP_Evaluation_results:** Contains the code that organizes and displays the results.
* **main_langchain_RAG:** The main code that evaluates the models and retrievers given the data.
* **read_pdf:** Extracts questions and answers from the given PDF and exports them into files we can work with.

### Questions Datasets
Contains all the datasets we created and attempted to use.

### Results
Contains the results, including plot files and table data.

### Embeddings
Contains the embeddings we created with the models we used.

### Text
The Torah text that we downloaded using the Sefaria API.
